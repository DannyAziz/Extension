It is hard to tell, which Twitter accounts are truly influential. This extension displays influence scores directly on Twitter profiles.

These are the same scores as available on [Hive.one](https://hive.one). You can choose to display scores for the Crypto Twitter or specific sub-clusters, such as BTC or ETH.
